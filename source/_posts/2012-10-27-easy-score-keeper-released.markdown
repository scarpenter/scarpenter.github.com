I'm happy to announce that my latest iOS app has been released. [Easy Score Keeper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-score-keeper/id570999111?ls=1&mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=GedyEx6hBKQ) is an app for keeping track of the score in board games, card games, or any game that has rounds and a score. It's designed to be simple enough that any family member can use it and gets out of your way so that you can get back to playing your game.

Easy Score Keeper is designed for both the iPhone/iPod Touch and the iPad.
